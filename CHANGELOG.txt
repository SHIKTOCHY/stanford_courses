  Various fixes addressing https://github.com/SU-SWS/stanford_courses/issues/12
    (cross-listed courses can have same course ID)
    -Added new text field to stanford_course and stanford_section content types to 
      more accurately track nodereference relationships between course nodes and
      section nodes
      -Note: if if upgrading from a previous version of the stanford_courses module, it is possible that this change could break node reference relationships between existing nodes.
